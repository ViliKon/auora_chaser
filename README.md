Welcome to Aurora Chasaer! The app that informs you when there is a possibility of seeing aurora lights.

This app required a lot of fetches, since there are many attributes to take into consideration when evaluating aurora visibility. 

Accessing the users location is crucial for this app. The app uses the users coordinates to evaluate aruora visibility near the users area. The users location is also used so it can be displayed on the map. 

As of now the app looks very simple from the users perspecitve, but there is alot going on in the background, which required try and catch cases to avoid the app from crashing or from anyh other problems. Also many points where the program checks specific data has been fetched to be able to display the necessary information. 

Navigation container is used so that users can switch from home page to the info page.

The app now can succesfully alert users when there is a possibility of seeing aurora lights and show the data that leads to those conclusions. n the future, I have hopes of making the UI better and flesing the app out more.
